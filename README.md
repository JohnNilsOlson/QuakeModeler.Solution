## Description
As a team-week project for Epicodus school we tasked ourselves with creating an application which would take a location from a user (city, county or state), and return the following:

* An interactive heat-map of earthquakes for the input region for the twenty years previous to date of inquiry;
* A list of these earthquakes with their respective latitudes and longitudes;
* The strength of these earthquakes (over a magnitude of 2.0);
* The probability that an earthquake would occur in the input region within the next month.
